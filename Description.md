# limited-to-full-colour-RGB-range-converter-shader
You got a Blu-ray or video file that was annoyingly rendered in the limited colour range? Everything all grey as a result? This soloution will provide a solution.
I created this after one of my Blu-rays were locked at the limited colour range; thankfully I knew how to make a shader to reverse this. PlayerFab supports Blu-ray playback with shaders.
This shader converts the limited colour range (16-235) to the full colour range (0-255).

This shader was created for PlayerFab but it should also work within MPC-HC aswell as other video players that support shaders such as Anime4K.
