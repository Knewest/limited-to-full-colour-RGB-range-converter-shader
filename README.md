# Limited (16－235) → Full (0－255) RGB Range Shader:
You got a Blu-ray/DVD or video file that was annoyingly mastered/rendered in the limited colour range? 
Everything all grey as a result? 
This soloution will provide a solution.

I created this after one of my Blu-rays were locked at the limited colour range; thankfully I knew how to make a shader to reverse this. PlayerFab supports Blu-ray playback with shaders.

This shader converts the limited colour range (16-235) to the full colour range (0-255).

This shader was created for PlayerFab but it should also work within MPC-HC aswell as other video players that support shaders such as Anime4K.

# How to import shader to use in PlayerFab:
1 - Follow the directory "C:\Program Files\DVDFab\Player 6\system\shaders\fx".

2 - Change 'C:' to whichever letter your drive is that contains PlayerFab.

3 - Unzip the file and place the .fx file inside of the folder.

4 - During video/disc playback right click the video and go to the 'Shaders' tab and find the installed solution.

Note: This is modified code from an unkown source and I didn't make this from scratch.
